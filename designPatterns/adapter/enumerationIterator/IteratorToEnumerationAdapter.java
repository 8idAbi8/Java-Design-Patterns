/*
 * Adapting an Iterator to an Enumeration.
 * 
 * While Java has gone in the direction of the Iterator, there is nevertheless a lot of legacy client code 
 * that depends on the Enumeration interface, so an Adapter that converts an Iterator to an Enumeration 
 * is also quite useful.
 * Write an Adapter that adapts an Iterator to an Enumeration. You can test your code by adapting an 
 * ArrayList. 
 * The ArrayList class supports the Iterator interface but doesnâ€™t support Enumerations 
 * (well, not yet anyway).
 *
